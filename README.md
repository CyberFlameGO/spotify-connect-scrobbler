spotify-connect-scrobbler
=========================
*spotify-connect-scrobbler* is a Last.fm scrobbler for Spotify. It uses
the Spotify Connect protocol to monitor Spotify listens and scrobble them
to Last.fm. This allows you to scrobble tracks played on Spotify Connect
devices without client-side Last.fm support (such as Amazon Alexa).

*spotify-connect-scrobbler* builds on top of [Paul Lietar (_plietar_)](https://github.com/plietar)'s
work on [librespot](https://github.com/plietar/librespot).
